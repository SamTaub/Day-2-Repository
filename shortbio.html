        <p>
            My name is Sam and I am currently a student in the University of Pennsylvania LPS Coding Bootcamp.
            I joined this program because I am hoping to start a meaningful career in web development.
            I enjoy coding because it invokes critical thinking, using logic, creativity, and most importantly - problem solving skills!
            I also have a passion for other areas of technology such as video games and smartphones.
            Other hobbies and interests include music, sports, and food.  
            Fun Fact:  I have a 17 year old dog - Sparky.  He likes to sleep and follow me around the house all the time.
